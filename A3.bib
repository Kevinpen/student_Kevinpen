abstract={Pathway enrichment analysis helps researchers gain mechanistic insight into gene lists generated from genome-scale (omics) experiments. This method identifies biological pathways that are enriched in a gene list more than would be expected by chance. We explain the procedures of pathway enrichment analysis and present a practical step-by-step guide to help interpret gene lists resulting from RNA-seq and genome-sequencing experiments. The protocol comprises three major steps: definition of a gene list from omics data, determination of statistically enriched pathways, and visualization and interpretation of the results. We describe how to use this protocol with published examples of differentially expressed genes and mutated cancer genes; however, the principles can be applied to diverse types of omics data. The protocol describes innovative visualization techniques, provides comprehensive background and troubleshooting guidelines, and uses freely available and frequently updated software, including g:Profiler, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), Cytoscape and EnrichmentMap. The complete protocol can be performed in {\textasciitilde}4.5 h and is designed for use by biologists with no prior bioinformatics training.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: Gene-set enrichment analysis is a useful technique to help functionally characterize large gene lists, such as the results of gene expression experiments. This technique finds functionally coherent gene-sets, such as pathways, that are statistically over-represented in a given gene list. Ideally, the number of resulting sets is smaller than the number of genes in the list, thus simplifying interpretation. However, the increasing number and redundancy of gene-sets used by many current enrichment analysis software works against this ideal. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To overcome gene-set redundancy and help in the interpretation of large gene lists, we developed "Enrichment Map", a network-based visualization method for gene-set enrichment results. Gene-sets are organized in a network, where each set is a node and edges represent gene overlap between sets. Automated network layout groups related gene-sets into network clusters, enabling the user to quickly identify the major enriched functional themes and more easily interpret the enrichment results. CONCLUSIONS: Enrichment Map is a significant advance in the interpretation of enrichment analysis. Any research project that generates a list of genes can take advantage of this visualization framework. Enrichment Map is implemented as a freely available and user friendly plug-in for the Cytoscape network visualization software (http://baderlab.org/Software/EnrichmentMap/).},

abstract={As a vital second messenger in the activation of lymphocytes, the divalent cation Ca(2+) plays numerous roles in adaptive immune responses. Importantly, Ca(2+) signaling is essential for T cell activation, tolerance of self-antigens, and homeostasis. Supporting the essential role of Ca(2+) signaling in T cell biology, the Ca(2+) regulated protein phosphatase calcineurin is a key target of pharmacologic inhibition for preventing allograft rejection and for autoimmune therapy. Recent studies have highlighted the unique role of Stim1 and Orai1/2 proteins in the regulation of store-operated/calcium release activated calcium (CRAC) channels in the context of T cells. While Ca(2+) is known to modulate T cell activation via effects on calcineurin and its target, nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), this second messenger also regulates other pathways, including protein kinase C, calmodulin kinases, and cytoskeletal proteins. Ca(2+) also modulates the unique metabolic changes that occur during in distinct T cell stages and subsets. Herein, we discuss the means by which Ca(2+) mobilization modulates cellular metabolism following T cell receptor ligation. Further, we highlight the crosstalk between mitochondrial metabolism, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and CRAC channel activity. As a target of mitochondrial ROS and Ca(2+) regulation, we describe the involvement of the serine/threonine kinase DRAK2 in the context of these processes. Given the important roles for Ca(2+) dependent signaling and cellular metabolism in adaptive immune responses, the crosstalk between these pathways is likely to be important for the regulation of T cell activation, tolerance, and homeostasis.},

	abstract = {Although genomewide RNA expression analysis has become a routine tool in biomedical research, extracting biological insight from such information remains a major challenge. Here, we describe a powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.},
